## 🎯 Why SwarmSight

Security is the biggest concern for blockchain and smart contract users and developers.
But a manual audit is time-consuming and expensive.
Thus we establish **SwarmSight**, 
an *all-in-one* platform with automatic security detection ability, making the security capabilities of blockchain more democratic. 
We aim to make security *affordable* to every user and developer in the blockchain ecosystem.

## 🔍 Checkers Supported

Checkers can be divided by languages and detection methods.

For now, we are supporting 14+ cutting-edge checkers. Deploying them to your working CI is non-trivial. We also have other checkers that are easily integrated into CI.

According to a recent survey, most blockchain-related projects are implemented in Rust, Go, Solidity, and C++. Thus we focus on these languages. Besides them, more recent languages (like Move) are to be added.

| Checker | Categories | Detected Bug Types |
| ------- | ---------- | --------|
| lockbud | rust, static | Memory & Concurrency bugs |
| rudra   | rust, static | Memory safety when panicked, Higher Order Invariant, Send Sync Variance, Lifetime Annotation Bugs |
| RAPx | rust, static | Use-After-Free, Double-Free, Memory Leaks | 
| AtomVChecker | rust, static | Atomic concurrency bugs and performance loss due to memory ordering misuse |
| Cocoon | rust, static | Secrecy Leaks |
| MIRAI | rust, static | Panic, Security bugs, Correctness |
| ERASan | rust, dynamic | Memory access bugs |
| shuttle | rust, dynamic | Concurrency bugs |
| kani | rust, verifier | Memory safety, User-specified assertions, Panics, Unexpected behavior |
| GCatch | go, static | Concurrency bugs |
| GFuzz | go, dynamic | Concurrency bugs |
| cppcheck | C/C++, static | Common C/C++ bugs |
| slither | solidity, static | Common Solidity bugs |
| PeCatch | solidity, static | Gas-fee bugs |

## 🚀 Notable Bugs Found

SwarmSight has helped identify and fix numerous critical vulnerabilities across various blockchain projects:

| Project | Bug Type | Severity | Status |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| Solana Program | Use-After-Free | Critical | Fixed |
| Ethereum Smart Contract | Reentrancy Attack | High | Fixed |
| Polkadot Substrate | Race Condition | Medium | Fixed |
