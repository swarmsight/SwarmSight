# SwarmSight

Advanced security analysis for blockchain ecosystems.

## Why SwarmSight

Security is the biggest concern for blockchain and smart contract users and developers.
But a manual audit is time-consuming and expensive.
Thus we establish **SwarmSight**, 
an *all-in-one* platform with automatic security detection ability, making the security capabilities of blockchain more democratic. 
We aim to make security *affordable* to every user and developer in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Checkers Supported

SwarmSight supports 14+ cutting-edge security checkers for Rust, Go, Solidity, and C++.

## Documentation

See individual checker directories for specific documentation.
